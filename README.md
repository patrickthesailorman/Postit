# Postit


This is a web based app primarily for freelance work, but anything really.
A user can create a post that describes services offered or services needed.
i.e. "I am a photographer" or "I need a photographer"...

Other Users can comment on these posts, and offer a possible match with their services or services needed.
i.e. " You are a photographer? well, I need a photographer!" or "You need a photographer? well, I am a Photographer!"
These could be quick tasks, long term employment or continuous side work. Not a only a great way to network in ones' particular industry but also to spill over into other similar industries or bridge the gaps into less confluent industries.

Users can include links in their posts and comments, as possible solutions or to invite others to relevant sites and news.
Users can vote on posts and comments and increase the vote count, which could signify that a Users' services are reccomended, that job offer is a good opportunity or a solution to a question asked is the most popular...there are many possibilities here.

This is just a begining and we believe a wonderful community can grow and develop here.

So get up and Postit!
